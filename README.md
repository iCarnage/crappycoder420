Hey y'all. I'm iCarnage. I am really interested in creating and listening/playing stuff (music, games, etc). 
I'd like to impact this world in some way, or in every way.

It's a really nice thing to live in a time where you can create the universe you want, the paintings you want, and the music you want, all within a single programming language.
